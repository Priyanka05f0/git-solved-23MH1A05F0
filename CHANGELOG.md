* Used *git pull (1 time)* to integrate remote changes into the local branch before performing Merge 2.

### Verified

* Ensured all changes were successfully fetched and merged without overwriting local commits.
* Confirmed synchronization by running git status and git log --oneline --graph.

* Final verification of branches, tags, and commit count before project submission.
* Ensured no pending files or unstaged changes remained.
